This repository was developed as part of a university assignment for the Object-Oriented Programming course. The project involves creating a car rental application using Java (NetBeans) with a database-driven architecture, designed to simplify and manage the car rental process for customers through an interactive user interface.
To run this program, please follow the instructions below:

1. Create a database named `log_db`.
2. Import the `log_db.sql` file into the database.
3. Update the port, URL, username, and password for the database connection according to your database configuration.
4. If there are any issues with the jCalendar library, please browse and select `jcalendar-1.4.jar`.
5. Update the `id_mobil` column in the database table, changing its data type to `int` and enabling the auto-increment feature.

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to run the program successfully. Enjoy using it! Thank you!
